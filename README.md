# Customer Relationship Management Project

The purpose of this project is to create a bespoke software application for the management of tenants in a London letting agency.

The main search entry is property identification (prop_id) and the output is the list of tenant(s) at the property with related documentations sent to the teneant, mostly by email.

The main data entry form contains office, property and tenant information. The first pane lists the property ID and landlord company of the flat. The second pane lists information on the flat: number, address, post code and city. The third pane lists tenant information: first name, last name and email. Visually the data entry form would look something like this.

|--Office information------------------|
|   Property ID   |  Landlord company  |
|--Property information----------------|
|  Flat # | Address | Post code | City |
|--Tenant information------------------|
|  First name  |  Last Name  |  Email  |
|--------------------------------------|
